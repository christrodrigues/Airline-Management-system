Description: The nonclustered index IX_Flight_Departure_Date_Time is created on the Departure_Date_Time column of the Flight table.
Purpose:

This index is designed to optimize queries that involve sorting, filtering, or searching based on the Departure_Date_Time of flights.
It enhances the performance of queries that retrieve flight information based on the departure date and time.
